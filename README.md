# README

This repository provides the code and the data supporting the paper "Revealing drivers and barriers in the diffusion of rooftop photovoltaics using explainable AI" by Dorothea Kistinger, Maurizio Titz, Michael T. Schaub, Sandra Venghaus, and Dirk Witthaut.

We implemented the analysis in Python. All requirements are given in *requirements.txt*.

### Structure

The *data* folder contains the input data to all GBT and LASSO simulations as well as the output of these simulations.

The *code* folder contains all the code required to replicate the results presented in the paper.
